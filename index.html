    <h2> Experiment 1: Digital Design </h2>

<p> This design was made with the Southworth planetarium’s main audience of children and family in mind. The first two logos incorporate USM colors to show the connection between the two. I really liked how the logos came together in the end, but the symmetry could be better. The small application of the logo has a lot of the same simple rounded shapes and colors without muddying up the image with smaller detail that would get lost from afar. The moons depicted behind the characters draw focus to the center, and the constellations to the side subtly make out the letters S and P to stand for Southworth Planetarium, which adds an aesthetically pleasing element without being too complex. The simple shapes and brighter colors serve to attract a younger audience, and depictions of family and the nostalgic red of the carpet attract an older, family-oriented audience.
