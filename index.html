    <h2> Experiment 1: Digital Design </h2>

<p> This design was made with the Southworth planetarium’s main audience of children and family in mind. The first two logos incorporate USM colors to show the connection between the two. I really liked how the logos came together in the end, but the symmetry could be better. The small application of the logo has a lot of the same simple rounded shapes and colors without muddying up the image with smaller detail that would get lost from afar. The moons depicted behind the characters draw focus to the center, and the constellations to the side subtly make out the letters S and P to stand for Southworth Planetarium, which adds an aesthetically pleasing element without being too complex. The simple shapes and brighter colors serve to attract a younger audience, and depictions of family and the nostalgic red of the carpet attract an older, family-oriented audience.

<p> It took me a long time to get used to using photoshop, but I feel much better equipped at it now than when I started. It also took a very long time to find all the right images to make my story work. I had to abandon certain ideas and replace them multiple times. Coming up with the backstory for the world that I made my projects based on was fun.The first image, which is the dystopia, needs different lighting, maybe more of a red tone than a dark tone because it seems hard to see. I’m happy with the orange color of the sky, but it might be enhanced more if it were a deep red. The brightness of the utopia image came out really well. The layout could be improved by spreading out the details more, and adding in a few more crow-people so it seems more like a community, but the crows flying out of the tree-house add a nice hint to this being a larger population living together.
